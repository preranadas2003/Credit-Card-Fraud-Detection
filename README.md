Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It addresses the issue of class imbalance through undersampling and oversampling methods and evaluates multiple models to find the most effective solution.

What I did in this project:

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling null values, scaling the 'Amount' feature, and removing duplicates.

Performed exploratory data analysis using heatmaps and class distribution visualizations.

Built and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.

Tackled class imbalance using undersampling and SMOTE-based oversampling.

Measured model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Saved the best-performing model and scaler using joblib for future use or deployment.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Joblib
